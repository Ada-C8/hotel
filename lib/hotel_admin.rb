# [] As an administrator, I can create a block of rooms
# [] To create a block you need a date range, collection of rooms and a discounted room rate
# [] The collection of rooms should only include rooms that are available for the given date range
# [] If a room is set aside in a block, it can't be reserved by the general public, nor can it be included in another block
# [] As an administrator, I can check whether a given block (needs block_id) has any rooms available
# [] As an administrator, I can reserve a room from within a block of rooms
