# Reserve block returns that instance of a block. Now what do i do?

# It doesn't matter if the block is hidden from the public now we have to call the method from within the block instance
# As an administrator, I can check whether a given block has any rooms available
# As an administrator, I can reserve a room from within a block of rooms


# As an administrator, I can create a block of rooms
# To create a block you need a date range, collection of rooms and a discounted room rate
# The collection of rooms should only include rooms that are available for the given date range
# If a room is set aside in a block, it is not available for reservation by the general public, nor can it be included in another block
