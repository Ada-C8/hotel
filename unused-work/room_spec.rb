- Room class makes ojects of room.
- Its attributes are:
- room number: each room must be 1-20

The hotel has 20 rooms, and they are numbered 1 through 20
- Every room is identical, and a room always costs $200/night
- The last day of a reservation is the checkout day, so the guest should not be charged for that night
- For this wave, any room can be reserved at any time, and you don't need to check whether reservations conflict with each other (this will come in wave 2!)
- Your code should raise an error when an invalid date range is provided
- A reservation is allowed start on the same day that another reservation for the same room ends
- Your code should raise an exception when asked to reserve a room that is not available


- Each room should have a room number.
- pass in the room number to the room object.
- to automate making all 20 rooms we need a times loop from 1-20.
- set an iterative variable to 1.
- errors for room numbers not on the sequence 1-20
- errors for reservation status not being either "reserved" or "vacant"
