What classes does each implementation include? Are the lists the same?
A: CartEntry, ShoppingCart, Order
B: CartEntry, ShoppingCart, Order
(The same!)

Write down a sentence to describe each class.
CartEntry: In both implementations, it collects the unit price and quantity. B will also find the price by multiplying the two arguments passed in.
ShoppingCart: Both create an array of items in the cart. In B, I _think_ it is trying to iterate through the entries array and add the price of each item in the cart to sum (it is unclear where entry.price is coming from, but I assume from CartEntry.price?)
Order: Each implementation finds the total price of the order, including tax. A does it by iterating through the entries array and adding each item with its own tax to a total price, whereas B adds tax to the final subtotal.

How do the classes relate to each other? It might be helpful to draw a diagram on a whiteboard or piece of paper.
CartEntry collects info of an item placed in the cart > ShoppingCart stores each entry into an array > Order calculates the total cost of items in the array, plus tax.

What data does each class store? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?
@unit_price, @quantity, @entries, @cart. They all seem the same to me--initialized the same and seem to hold the same information.

What methods does each class have? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?
Each class has an initialize method. Both Order classes have a total_price method. implementation B has an additional price method for its CartEntry and ShoppingCart classes.

_Consider the Order#total_price method. In each implementation:
Is logic to compute the price delegated to "lower level" classes like ShoppingCart and CartEntry, or is it retained in Order?


Does total_price directly manipulate the instance variables of other classes?
No

If we decide items are cheaper if bought in bulk, how would this change the code? Which implementation is easier to modify?

Which implementation better adheres to the single responsibility principle?

Bonus question once you've read Metz ch. 3: Which implementation is more loosely coupled?
